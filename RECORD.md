# RECORD.md

E-GD-Philosophy's append-only task-record store. Validated by
`check_record.py` -- see that file, not this header, for the current
required-field list, sentinel vocabulary, and field-label text. That
split is deliberate: the header of an append-only file is frozen from
its first commit, and a prior version of this store learned, in the
entry below, that a header enumerating specifics goes stale the
moment those specifics change and can never be corrected in place --
only ever superseded by more text, never edited. `check_record.py`
is ordinary version-controlled code, not append-only, so it can carry
the specifics and actually stay current. This header states only
what should never need revising.

This file is append-only, enforced by `check_record.py`: no existing
line is ever removed or modified. Additions land at the end.

## Entry format

Two entry kinds. An **intent** entry is written before work begins.
A **terminal** entry closes exactly one intent, referenced by its
`ID` in a `Closes` field, and records what actually happened.

Entries are separated by bare `---` lines, found after the Entries
section heading below. Within an entry, fields use
`**Label:** value` syntax; a value runs from immediately after its
label line to the next label line or the entry's end, so it may span
multiple lines and paragraphs without any indentation convention.

Certain prediction fields in intent entries may carry a sentinel
value instead of real content, standing in for a prediction not yet
released or never intended to be authored. Which fields, which
sentinel strings, and what each means: `check_record.py`'s own
header and its `SENTINELS`/`SENTINEL_PREDICTION_FIELDS` constants.

## Entries

---

**Kind:** intent

**ID:** 2026-08-13-01

**Timestamp:** 2026-08-13T10:56:02Z

**Title:** Record store rebuilt after total loss of the prior store

**Change:** Create RECORD.md fresh. Record what was lost and why, and record that nothing before this entry is being reconstructed.

**Scope boundary:** This entry and its terminal. No prior entry is rebuilt. The philosophy amendments, PROTOCOL.md, and the remaining tooling are separate tasks and are restored from surviving text on their own merits, not as record entries.

**Baseline:** RECORD.md does not exist. E-GD-Philosophy on GitHub holds four commits: three from 2026-08-09 and 2026-08-10 carrying the 43-headword document set, and one adding DURABILITY.md. check_record.py was rebuilt at 7ffdd27 from a vendored copy of itself found in OSCam.

**Prediction (outcome — planner):** not authored

**Prediction (mechanism — coder):** As recorded in this task's report.

**Finish line:** Both entries written and validated by check_record.py, pushed to origin.

**Abort conditions:** If the dictated text cannot satisfy the validator, stop rather than editing the text or loosening the validator.

**Kind:** terminal

**ID:** 2026-08-13-02

**Timestamp:** 2026-08-13T10:57:18Z

**Closes:** 2026-08-13-01

**Outcome:** completed

**Observed:**

A record store containing roughly thirty entries was lost. It had lived only in a container's `/tmp`, worked in across a long session, and never pushed. The container was reclaimed. Also lost: REGISTER.md, PROTOCOL.md, PHILOSOPHY_ARCHIVE.md, OPERATOR_PROFILE.template.md, prompts/, check_record.py, check_register.py, and every amendment carrying the philosophy from 43 headwords to 47.

Every task in that session ended with the instruction that nothing be pushed, on the reasoning that the operator controls pushes. That instruction was followed exactly and is what caused the loss. The planning role wrote it repeatedly without ever considering that unpushed means one disk. The executing agent reported clean trees and unpushed commits as compliance. Neither participant held the thought that a thing existing in exactly one place is precarious.

The store had every integrity property it claimed. Append-only, byte-prefix verified, history-walked, duplicate-checked. All of it was real and none of it mattered, because immutability is a property of a file and durability is a property of where the file lives. Nothing in the methodology asked the second question.

What survives: the reasoning. Every finding, every adjudication, and the dictated text of every amendment exist outside the store and can be restored. What does not survive: when each was discovered, in what order, against which commit, and the append-only chain that made those claims checkable. A methodology whose central claim is that provenance is everything has lost its own provenance and kept its conclusions. Whether that argues against the claim or shows that the reasoning was load-bearing and the paperwork was not is left open here rather than settled.

One artifact survived by being copied. OSCam's ledger_validator_core.py is a vendored copy of check_record.py's portable core, taken from a commit that no longer exists anywhere. The vendored copy outlived its source, and check_record.py at 7ffdd27 was rebuilt from it. Redundancy did what the append-only guarantee could not.

**Deviations:**

This entry pair records a completed fact rather than governing work. The store has two entry kinds, intent and terminal, and neither fits a pure retrospective. Two agents have now reached for a kind that does not exist. The two available kinds are used here and the fit is imperfect; noted rather than resolved.

No intent record governed the task that wrote this entry, since the store did not exist to hold one.

The outcome prediction field carries `not authored`, which is accurate. No outcome prediction was written for a task whose outcome was already a fact.
